## Background 
I can't help feeling that Angular, React etc are solving the wrong problem or even making the problem worse. React in particular seems to be popular because of its performance (only update _dirty_ elements) and JSX (a mix of HTML and imperative - JS - code which used to be frowned upon back in the J2EE days of JSPs but hey).

Keep the number of elements on a page to a minimum and you probably don't need a Framework. Need to display a table of many rows? Use paging!
